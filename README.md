# Tamagotchi
This project was part of ACM UCLA's Hack Sprint Program, which was held in January 2022. I made some of my own adjustments to the code, but the general functionality of the app is the same as ACM's version.  
## What it does
The player gets a score for every second the Tamagotchi survives. The Tamagotchi dies when it's health reaches 0. The facial expressions of the Tamagotchi will vary depending on its health. If the Tamagotchi dies, you can restart using the button on the top-left corner.
